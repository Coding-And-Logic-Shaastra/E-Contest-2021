PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Let S be a string of length 4 consisting of digits ‘0’ to ‘9’. How many strings are there such that the string contains only odd number zeroes? Print the final answer alone.

Note that it is a 4-digit string and not a 4-digit number.

CONSTRAINTS : 0 <= a <= b <= 9

TIME ALLOWED : 5sec

NOTE : 
Print the string representing the answer not the character with answer as it's ASCII value.
So, if the answer is 12345 the output should be "12345".
