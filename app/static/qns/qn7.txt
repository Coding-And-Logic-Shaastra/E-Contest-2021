				NEVER DENY ANYTHING IF FREE!

PROBLEM STATEMENT :
American Express also gives an option of getting supplementary cards for free with the purchase of each credit card.					

For example for an American Express Platinum Card one can get 4 supplementary cards for free. 
There are totally ‘b’ uniques types of credit cards marketed by Amex. 
Now your task is to find the total number of supplementary cards that can be obtained for free, 
given that you purchase 'a' credit cards with each of them allowing ‘c’ supplementary cards for free.

TIME ALLOWED : 5sec

MEMORY LIMIT : Maximum 10^5 commands are only allowed.
